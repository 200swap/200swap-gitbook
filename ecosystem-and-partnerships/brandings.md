## Key Usage Rules

1. **Use the Official Color Only**\
   The primary logo color must always be **#8A63D2**. Do not change, replace, or alter this color in any version of the logo.
2. **Do Not Modify the Logo**\
   The logo must remain in its original form. No stretching, recoloring, adding effects, cropping, rotating, or altering proportions.
3. **Ensure Clear Space & Visibility**\
   Keep enough clear space around the logo to maintain readability, and always place it on a clean, high-contrast background for maximum visibility.
