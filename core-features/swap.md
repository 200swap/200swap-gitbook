# Swap

We’re a DEX but we don’t run our own liquidity pools. 200Swap uses [0xproject](https://0x.org/)’s service to get the quotes and execute swaps. That means you can swap ANY token on Monad. Check out our [Trading Fee](trading-fee.md)

Since we are building on top of the Clanker ecosystem on Monad, every Clanker token on Monad will be automatically listed on 200Swap.
