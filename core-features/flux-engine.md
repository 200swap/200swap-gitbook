# Flux Engine

## Overview

Flux Engine is a CASHBACK value system for 200Swap users, where the more volume you swap, the more **FLUX** you earn.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
1 dollar swapped = 1 flux
{% endhint %}

## Flux

Flux is the main fuel of the Flux Engine.

Use cases of Flux:

* Based for CASHBACK [2S Token](../2s-token/2s-is-clanker-token.md) from Flux Vault.
* Based to airdrop for Flux Leaderboard, the top of user who has Flux.

## Rules

{% hint style="info" %}
When the Flux Engine launches at first, we will publish '**invite codes'** on our social channels, and each code can only be used once.

After you join Flux Engine, you’ll receive your own '**referral code'**, which you can share with your friends so you can earn referral Flux.
{% endhint %}

* You need a reference code to join.
* Swaps between $MON and $WMON don’t count for Flux rewards.

## Referral System

* You earn 20% Flux from your direct referrals.
* You earn 5% Flux from their referrals too.
